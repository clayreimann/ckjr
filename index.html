                <div class="item-description">
                  <p style="text-align: justify;">Kaitlyn and Clay first crossed paths July 1st, 2013, when Clay was, unknowingly, standing in front of Kaitlyn in a line to hand in paperwork at their new "big kid" jobs at Epic. When Clay told the lady collecting the paperwork that he
                    had left most of his paperwork at home, Kaitlyn silently snickered at Clay for not remembering his paperwork and for being rather overdressed the first day at his new job. On July 2nd, they officially met when they walked out of the
                    orientation classroom at the same time. Kaitlyn remembered him from the day before (it helped that he was overdressed yet again) and playfully teased him as they went together to hand in his paperwork. She invited him to have lunch
                    with her and her officemate, Brynn Bailey, and the next day she invited him to have lunch again and to see the fireworks at the Memorial Union Terrace with her and her friends! From then on, Kaitlyn and Clay were together pretty much
                    every night-going to the concerts on the square, studying for work, watching movies, and staying up much too late to spend time together.</p>
                  <p style="text-align: justify;"> On July 17th, Clay decided that Kaitlyn was his girlfriend, and she decided this made her happy, too! The next 3 years of dating flew by with lots of adventures traveling together, moving from apartment to apartment in Madison and then
                    down to Champaign, Illinois, watching movies and binging on Netflix, listening to countless hours of Audible together, going on hikes and trying not to get bitten by rattlesnakes. :)</p>

                <div class="item-title">The Proposal</div>
                <div class="item-description">
                  <p style="text-align: justify;">At the end of July, Kaitlyn and Clay found themselves in Seattle on a family trip with Clay's family. They had signed up to go paragliding but hadn't quite realized what that meant at the time. Kaitlyn was almost in tears for how scared
                    she was as they ascended to the top of the mountain that they were going to run off of. Kaitlyn was the very first person to go, giving Clay a big hug right before she took off. As she got in the air, she told her instructor to help
                    keep an eye on Clay because she was going to marry him some day, even if he hadn't realized it yet. Little did she know, Clay was down on the mountain-top telling <em>his</em> instructor that he needed to land before Kaitlyn did. The
                    instructor couldn't guarantee anything, but said he would try after Clay explained that he was going to ask Kaitlyn to marry him as soon as she landed. </p>
                  <p style="text-align: justify;">Clay was the first person in the group to land, and Kaitlyn landed right after him, worrying that she was going to run right into him on ground! Once she got unhooked from her wing, Clay came over and asked how she was feeling. She replied
                    that she was happy to be on the ground again and trying not to throw up, but it had been super fun! Clay then said, <strong>"You just jumped off a cliff, right?"</strong> Then he got down on one knee and asked, <strong>"Would you jump off another cliff with me? Will you marry me?"</strong>                    Kaitlyn of course said <strong>yes</strong> and started crying!!!! </p>

                <div class="item-description">
                  <p style="text-align: justify;">Clay and Kaitlyn now live in Champaign, IL where Clay works as a Software Developer at Yahoo and Kaitlyn works as a Healthcare Technician at Carle Hospital's Heart and Vascular Institute in the Prep and Recovery area. They spend their
                    weeks enjoying lovely meals cooked by Clay and delicious baked goods that Kaitlyn makes and work out with their trainer twice a week and attempt to do other exercisey things to help combat the previously mentioned baked goods. Clay
                    and Kaitlyn often travel together on weekends and are enjoying their last months together in Champaign before they move to Waukesha, WI where Kaitlyn will start her Physician Assistant program at Carroll University on May 30th!!</p>

                        shenanigans. Kaitlyn is so blessed to consider Danielley as one of her best friends and to have her by her side on her wedding day!</p>
